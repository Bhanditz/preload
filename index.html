    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Modern browsers leverage a wide variety of speculative optimization techniques to anticipate user input and intent, which allows them to hide some of the networking, processing, and rendering latencies: preconnects, early fetching of resources, and prefetching and processing of resources for subsequent navigation.</p>

    <p>The decision to initiate one or more of the above optimization is typically based on heuristic rules based on document markup and structure, navigation history, and context of the user - e.g. type of device, available compute and memory resources, network connectivity, user preferences, and so on. These techniques have proven to be successful, but can be further improved by leveraging the application and page specific knowledge of the developer or the servers responsible for generation and delivery of these resources.</p>

    <p>For example, the application may provide the following resource hints to the user agent:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The list of origins from which resources will be fetched.</li>
      <li>The list of resources that will be used to construct the page.</li>
      <li>The next user action or navigation target, and the resources that will be required, based on current page or application state, individual user history, or aggregated session data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many web applications already leverage a variety prefetching techniques, such as using XMLHttpRequest to prefetch and cache assets before they are needed. However, these implementations are app-specific, are not interoperable with the browser-provided primitives, and do not provide the same level of performance, or worse, conflict and result in delayed or unnecessary downloads that degrade overall page performance.</p>

    <p>This specification defines <a>preconnect</a>, <a>preload</a>, and <a>prerender</a> hints that the developer, or the server generating or delivering the resources, can use in an interoperable way to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, which resources it should fetch to improve performance, and which resources may be required by the next navigation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Resource Hints</h2>

    <p>Resource hints are used to assist the user agent in the decision making process of which optimizations can be applied when the page is being loaded, or as the user is interacting with the application.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a>Preconnect</a> is used to indicate origins from which resources will be fetched.</li>
      <li><a>Preload</a> is used to indicate resources that will be required by the current navigation context.</li>
      <li><a>Prerender</a> is used to indicate resources that may be required by the next navigation context.</li>
    </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Preconnect</h2>

      <p>The <dfn>preconnect</dfn> hint is used to indicate an origin that will be used to fetch required resources. Initiating an early connection, which includes the DNS lookup, TCP handshake, and optional TLS negotiation, allows the user agent to mask the high costs of connection establishment latency.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight html">
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//example.com"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//cdn.example.com"&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>The optimal number of connections per origin is dependent on the negotiated protocol, users current connectivity profile, available device resources, and other context specific variables. As a result, this decision is deferred to the user agent, which is in the best position to determine the optimal number.</p>

      <p>The user agent should perform the full connection handshake (DNS+TCP for HTTP, and DNS+TCP+TLS for HTTPS origins) whenever possible, but is allowed to elect to perform a partial handshake (DNS only for HTTP, and DNS or DNS+TCP for HTTPS origins), or skip it entirely, due to resource constraints or other reasons.</p>

      <div class="example informative">
        The full resource URL may not be known until the page is being constructed by the user agent - e.g. conditional loading logic, UA adaptation, etc. However, the origin from which one or more of these resources will be fetched is often known ahead of time by the developer or the server generating the response. In such cases, a <a title="preconnect">preconnect hint</a> can be used to initiate an early connection handshake such that when the resource URL is determined, the user agent can dispatch the request without first blocking on connection negotiation.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        Many sites rely on redirects for analytics and to anonymize the referrer before sending the user to the final destination. Because the destination is known ahead of time, a <a title="preconnect">preconnect hint</a> can be used to initiate the connection handshake with the destination origin in parallel with the processing of the redirect. Note that this behavior requires ability to dynamically inject the hint (e.g. as part of a JavaScript handler), and for the preconnect processing to proceed across page navigations.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Preload</h2>

      <p>The <dfn>preload</dfn> hint is used to indicate the URL of a resource that should be fetched as early as possible by the user agent. Initiating an early fetch allows the user agent to mask the request latency of the resource and make it available sooner to the application.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight html">
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/font.woff" as="font"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/logo.webp" as="image"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/app.js" as="script"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/mobile-ui-framework.js" as="script" media="screen and (max-width: 640px)"&gt;
      </pre>

      <ul>
        <li>The <a>as</a> attribute is used to indicate the resource destination context - see
          <a href="#fetch-settings"></a>.</li>
        <li>The user agent should fetch and retain the preloaded response, without executing or processing it, until it is matched with a matching request (see
          <a href="#matching-hint-responses-with-requests"></a>).</li>
        <li>The preloaded response must not delay the `load` event of the document unless it is matched with a matching request, and the user agent must fire a simple event indicating the status of the fetch attempt (see
          <a href="#hint-execution"></a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        Resource hints are subject to <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#attr-link-media">media query processing rules</a>: the user agent must initiate resource fetch when media attribute's value matches the environment, and must not initiate the fetch otherwise.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        The <a title="preload">preload hint</a> can be used by the application to initiate early fetch, but delay processing of the received response - e.g. fetch a CSS stylesheet and apply it at some later time, fetch a JavaScript asset and execute it later, and so on. Preload fetches do not block the document `load` event and allow the application to determine which resources are applied, when they are executed, and in which order.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        Speculative parsers do not execute JavaScript and perform a shallow parse of CSS, which means that the fetch of resources specified within JavaScript and CSS is delayed until the document parser is able to process the resource declaration. By using a <a title="preload">preload hint</a> the application can declaratively specify which resources the user agent should fetch early to mask the request latency and improve page performance.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        The <a title="preload">preload hint</a> can be generated both by the application and an optimization proxy (e.g. a CDN) to accelerate fetch and delivery of required resources.

        <ol>
          <li>The application can specify preload hints, allowing:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The optimization proxy to initiate early fetch of the associated resources and place them into its cache, thus reducing or eliminating the latency of retrieving resources from the origin.</li>
            <li>The user agent to initiate early fetch of required resources - see example above.</li>
          </ul>

          <li>The optimization proxy can specify preload hints on behalf of the application:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The proxy can observe and infer required resources based on past request patterns, allowing it to automate generation of relevant preload hints to improve performance.</li>
            <li>The proxy can deliver inferred preload hints to the user agent while it is blocked on the response from the origin, allowing the user agent to begin fetching required resources.</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>Many optimization proxies already implement the "early flush" strategy where references to required resources are delivered to the user agent while the proxy is blocked on the response from the origin. Today, this is typically done by synthesizing a document header that contains XHR, image, and object requests. However, in practice, these implementations often result in prioritization conflicts with requests initiated by speculative and document parsers, or worse, result in delayed or double downloads due to missing context information. The <a title="preload">preload hint</a> addresses these problems by providing a declarative hint that communicates both the URL and the context of the resource.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Prerender</h2>

      <p>The <dfn>prerender</dfn> hint is used to indicate the URL and the context of a resource required by the next navigation. Initiating an early fetch of the specified resource allows the user agent to mask the request latency, and optional preprocessing of the fetched response allows the user agent to deliver an experience of instant delivery and execution once the resource is requested.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight html">
  &lt;link rel="prerender" href="//example.com/thankyou.html"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="prerender" href="//example.com/application.js" as="script"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="prerender" href="//example.com/image.webp" as="image" media="max-width: 640px"&gt;
      </pre>

      <div class="note">
        <a>Prerender</a> is not restricted to HTML and may be used to load and preprocess any content-type.
      </div>

      <p>The user agent may perform appropriate preprocessing depending on the type and destination context of the response - e.g. decode an image, parse the HTML markup, parse the HTML markup and initiate fetches for critical subresources, and so on. The decision for which preprocessing steps are performed is deferred to the user agent and is a function of runtime context and specified hint probability - see
        <a href="#required-vs-speculative-hints"></a>.</p>

      <p>Prerendering should not negatively impact the performance of the current navigation context. Due to the need to fetch and optionally preprocess the specified resource and its associated assets, prerendering may result in high contention for CPU, GPU, memory, and network resources. As a result, the user agent may implement various strategies to minimize resource contention based on type and context of fetched response, impose limits on the properties of the resource that is being prerendered, and so on:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The optimal time to initiate fetch of a <a>prerender</a> resource is dependent on the negotiated protocol, users current connectivity profile, available device resources, and other context specific variables. As a result, this decision is deferred to the user agent, which is in the best position to determine the optimal time - e.g. the user agent may decide to wait until all other downloads are finished, or choose to pipeline requests with low priority if the negotiated protocol supports the necessary primitives.</li>

        <li>The priority of <a>prerender</a> requests should be lower than that of resources required by the current navigation context.</li>
        <li>To minimize resource contention the prerendered content may be processed with lower priority.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The background render may be allocated fewer CPU, GPU, or memory resources.</li>
          <li>Some resource requests may be delayed until the prerendered resource is made visible - e.g. media downloads, plugin content, and similar requests may be delayed when an HTML response is preprocessed.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Prerender may be abandoned due to resource constraints.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Limited available resources may prevent prerender from being initiated.</li>
          <li>High resource requirements of the content being prerendered may lead the user agent to cancel the prerender - e.g. exceeded memory requirements, high CPU usage, and so on.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Prerender may be abandoned based on the type or properties of the prerendered content. For example, when prerendering an HTML response:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If the target exhibits non-idempotent behavior: mutations to shared local storage, XMLHttpRequest with a verb other than GET, HEAD, or OPTION, and so on.</li>
          <li>If the target triggers a condition that requires user input: confirmation dialogs, authentication prompts, alerts, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        The above examples are not an exhaustive list. The decision which strategies to implement for each content-type and how to enforce them is deferred to the user agent. For a hands-on example of HTML prerendering strategies, see <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/prerender">Chromium prerendering</a> wiki page.
      </div>

      <p>The user agent should not cancel outstanding prerender requests when a new navigation is triggered as they may be required by the next page. However, the user agent may cancel these requests once it determines that they are not required by the new destination.</p>

      <p>To ensure compatibility and improve the success rate of prerender requests the target page should use the [[PAGE-VISIBILITY]] to determine the visibility state of the page as it is being rendered and implement appropriate logic to avoid actions that may cause the prerender to be abandoned (e.g. non-idempotent requests), or unwanted side-effects from being triggered (e.g. analytics beacons firing prior to the page being displayed).</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>The <a title="prerender">prerender hint</a> can be used to implement a prefetch strategy that leverages app-specific knowledge about the next navigation based on content, structure, analytics, or other signals - e.g. high-likelihood search results, paginated content or step-driven flows, aggregated analytics or per-user behavior, and so on.</p>

        <p>For example, an image gallery may have knowledge about the likelihood of the next photo or page that may be requested by the user. To provide an improved experience the application can ask the user agent to begin fetching required resources (individual photos, critical resources, or the full page) before the next navigation is triggered.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, instead of anticipating user activity, the application can react to user input and dynamically schedule prerender requests based on its knowledge of resources that will be required by the next navigation target - i.e. the application may capture a click event and provide prerender hints to the user agent before the current page is unloaded.</p>
      </div>

  <section>
    <h2>Processing model</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Fetch settings</h2>

      <p>Specifying the <dfn>as</dfn> attribute allows the developer to communicate the resource destination context, such that the user agent can initialize the appropriate fetch settings: HTTP headers, request priority, and so on.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight html">
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/font.woff" as="font"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/logo.webp" as="image"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/widget"&gt;
      </pre>

      <ul>
        <li>The specified <a>as</a> value must be a valid <a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-context">request context</a> as defined in [[FETCH]].</li>
        <li>If the <a>as</a> attribute is missing, the user agent should assign a default context.</li>
        <li>Request defaults set by the user agent via <a>as</a> attribute must match the default settings set by the user agent when processing a resource with the same context - this is necessary to guarantee correct prioritization and request matching (see
          <a href="#matching-hint-responses-with-requests"></a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In addition to the fetch settings set by the resource destination context, the user agent must account for the relative hint priority: <a>preload</a> requests must have higher priority than <a>prerender</a> requests with the same context. In the case where the same resource has mixed prioritization hints, the user agent should resolve the conflict:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the request has not yet been dispatched, the user agent should use the highest specified priority.</li>
        <li>If the request has been dispatched, and if negotiated protocol supports it, the user agent should update request priority to the highest specified priority.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        The resource destination context communicated via the <a>as</a> attribute is used to initialize appropriate fetch settings; the communicated context should not be used to enforce security or other resource policies.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Required vs speculative hints</h2>

      <p>In addition to specifying the hint type, its fetch parameters, and the resource URL, the developer can communicate the expected probability that the resource will be used in the current or next navigation context.</p>

      <pre class="highlight example html">
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//sub.example.com" probability="0.22"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/application.js" probability="0.75"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="prerender" href="//example.com/thankyou.html" probability="1.0"&gt;
</pre>

      <p>The <dfn>probability</dfn> attribute is a float value in the [0.0-1.0] range:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Required hint:</strong>a hint with probability of 1.0 that must be processed by the user agent.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Speculative hint:</strong>a hint with probability of &lt;1.0 that should be processed by the user agent.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If the <a>probability</a> attribute is omitted, the hint is considered to be a speculative hint and the user agent may use own heuristics to assign a default probability value.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p>Speculative hints are processed on a best effort basis by the user agent based on the runtime context of the user agent &mdash; availability of CPU, GPU, memory, and networking resources &mdash; developer specified probability indicating the likelihood of that resource being used, and specified user preferences.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The user agent may decide to execute some, none, or all of the optimizations implied by a speculative resource hint, and may also invoke additional optimizations based on its own heuristics.</li>

        <li>The user agent may decide to execute a partial optimization relative to the speculative hint due to resource constraints or other reasons.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><a>preconnect</a> may fallback to a partial handshake (DNS only, or DNS+TCP for HTTPS origins).</li>
          <li><a>preload</a> may fallback to <a>preconnect</a> for specified origin.</li>
          <li><a>prerender</a> may fallback to a mixed strategy for the target resource, and if applicable, its subresources: <a>preconnect</a> only; fetch the target resource but defer fetch of subresources; fetch subresources but delay their processing, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <p>To optimize the overall user experience the user agent should account for local context and specified probability of a speculative hint. For example, on a resource constrained device the user agent may decide to only execute high probability hints. Alternatively, it may decide to perform partial processing of the hint, such as downgrading <a>preload</a> to <a>preconnect</a>, <a>prerender</a> to <a>preload</a>, performing a partial <a>prerender</a>, and so on.</p>

        <p>Performing a partial optimization allows the user agent to improve performance even if a full optimization cannot be performed. Conversely, on a device with sufficient resources, the user agent may execute all of the specified hints as far as possible.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="issue">
        TBD: do we need a carve-out clause for "required prerender hint"? E.g. current browsers allow the user to opt-out from prerender. However, required preconnect and preload hints, which apply to current context, must be respected by the user agent.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hint execution</h2>

      <p>The user agent must not delay the `load` event of the document unless the hint-initiated fetch is matched with a matching request that blocks the `load` event of the document.</p>

      <p>Once the the attempt to obtain the hint-initiated resource is complete, the user agent must, if the fetch was successful, queue a task to fire a simple event named `load` at the link element, or, if the fetch failed to complete for any reason, queue a task to fire a simple event named `error` at the link element.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the user agent is executing a required hint, then the `load` event on the link element is an indicator that the hint was processed to completion.</li>
        <li>If the user agent is executing a speculative hint, then the `load` event on the link element is an indicator that the user agent has performed full or partial processing on the hint (see
          <a href="#required-vs-speculative-hints"></a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <pre class="example highlight html">
&lt;script&gt;
  function hintLoaded() { ... }
  function hintError()  { ... }

  var hint = document.createElement("link")
  hint.setAttribute("rel", "preload")
  hint.setAttribute("as", "image")
  hint.setAttribute("href", "/image.jpeg")
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(hint)

  // listen for load/error events
  hint.addEventListener("load", function() { hintLoaded() })
  hint.addEventListener("error", function() { hintError() })
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- listen for load/error events --&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="app.js" as="script" onload="hintLoaded()" onerror="hintError()"&gt;
      </pre>

      <div class="note">
        The decision on whether a speculative hint is executed, and if so, whether full or partial processing is applied is deferred to the user agent. As a result, the `load` and `error` events are not guaranteed to fire for a speculative hint, and when they do, do not guarantee that full processing was applied.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        The application may use the `load` event on a <a>preload</a> hint as an indicator that the resource has been successfully fetched and is now ready to be processed by the application - e.g. the image is ready to be decoded, a stylesheet or script may be applied, and so on, without blocking on the network.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dynamic scheduling</h2>
      <p>In addition to the hints specified in the document markup, the application may have runtime resource hints based on user context or other signals. The user agent should process dynamically inserted resource hints in addition to and in the same way as document specified hints.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight js">
  // insert new prerender hint
  var hint = document.createElement("link")
  hint.setAttribute("rel", "prerender")
  hint.setAttribute("href", "/article/part3.html")
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(hint)

  // cancel prerender
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].removeChild(hint);
      </pre>

      <p>The removal of the hint from the document should cancel the optimization if it is being processed and prevent it from executing if it has not yet been invoked.</p>

      <div class="example">
        The application may use dynamic scheduling to react and adapt to user initiated actions - e.g. initiate a speculative resource fetch in response to recent user activity, cancel previous speculative fetch, and so on.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Interoperability with HTTP Link header</h2>
      <p>The user agent should process resource hints specified via the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">Link HTTP header</a>.</p>

      <pre class="example">
  Link: &lt;https://example.com&gt;; rel=preconnect
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/font.woff&gt;; rel=preload; as=font
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/article/part2.html&gt;; rel=prerender
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/logo-hires.jpg&gt;; rel=prerender; as=image; media=min-resolution:2dppx
      </pre>

      <p>The application may provide one or more of the same type of hint via multiple HTTP headers or via a comma separated list. The user agent should process such hints in addition to and in the same way as document specified and dynamically scheduled resource hints.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>Delivering resource hints via `Link` header allows automated optimization services running on origin or upstream servers (e.g. CDN) to leverage and emit resource hints without modifying the delivered response.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The optimization service may leverage specified hints to preconnect, preload, or prefetch resources into its own cache, which will assist in faster delivery when the request arrives from the client.</li>
          <li>The optimization service may emit resource hints based own optimization heuristics (e.g. inferred page structure, request patterns, and so on) to assist the user agent.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Matching hint responses with requests</h2>

      <p>Resources fetched via <a>preload</a> and <a>prerender</a> are retained by the user agent until they are fetched with a matching request. The user agent may decide to discard the retained response due to resource constraints, a timeout (recommended, at least 300 seconds), or other reasons.</p>

      <div class="example">
        A JavaScript resource is fetched via <a>preload</a> and the response contains a `no-cache` directive. The fetched response is retained by the user agent and is immediately returned when fetched with a matching request at a later time - e.g. via a `script` tag or other means. This ensures that the user agent does not incur an unnecessary revalidation, or a duplicate download, between the initial resource fetch initiated via the specified resource hint and a later fetch requesting the same resource.
      </div>

      <div class="note">
        The concept of "matching" is not currently defined or interoperable across user agents. This should be fixed, but it is out of scope of this specification.
