    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Modern browsers leverage a wide variety of speculative optimization techniques to anticipate user input and intent, which allows them to hide some of the networking, processing, and rendering latencies: preconnects, early fetching of resources, and preloading and processing of resources for subsequent navigation.</p>

    <p>The decision to initiate one or more of the above optimizations is typically based on heuristic rules based on document markup and structure, navigation history, and context of the user - e.g., type of device, available compute and memory resources, network connectivity, user preferences, and so on. These techniques have proven to be successful, but can be further improved by leveraging the knowledge a developer has about the front-end and backend-end generation and delivery of the resources of a web application.</p>

    <p>For example, the application may provide the following resource hints to the user agent:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The list of origins from which resources will be fetched.</li>
      <li>The list of resources that will be used to construct the page.</li>
      <li>The next likely user action or navigation target, and the resources that will be required, based on current page or application state, individual user history, or aggregated session data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many web applications already leverage a variety of prefetching techniques. This includes, but is not limited to, using XMLHttpRequest to prefetch and cache assets before they are needed. However, these implementations are app-specific, are not interoperable with the browser-provided primitives, and do not provide the same level of performance. Worse, these implementations sometimes conflict with the browser logic and result in delayed or unnecessary resource fetches that degrade overall page performance.</p>

    <p>This specification defines <a>preconnect</a> and <a>preload</a> hints that the developer, or the server generating or delivering the resources, can use in an interoperable way to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, and which resources it should fetch to improve page performance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Resource Hints</h2>

    <p><dfn>Resource hints</dfn> are used to assist the user agent in the decision making process of which optimizations can be applied when the page is being loaded, or as the user is interacting with the application.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a>Preconnect</a> is used to indicate origins from which resources will be fetched.</li>
      <li><a>Preload</a> is used to indicate resources that should be fetched to improve page performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Preconnect</h2>

      <p>The <dfn>preconnect</dfn> hint is used to indicate an origin that will be used to fetch required resources. Initiating an early connection, which includes the DNS lookup, TCP handshake, and optional TLS negotiation, allows the user agent to mask the high latency costs of establishing a connection.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight html">
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//example.com"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//cdn.example.com"&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>The optimal number of connections per origin is dependent on the negotiated protocol, users current connectivity profile, available device resources, and other context specific variables. As a result, this decision is deferred to the user agent, which is in the best position to determine the optimal number of connections per origin.</p>

      <p>The user agent SHOULD perform the full connection handshake (DNS+TCP for HTTP, and DNS+TCP+TLS for HTTPS origins) whenever possible, but is allowed to elect to perform a partial handshake (DNS only for HTTP, and DNS or DNS+TCP for HTTPS origins), or skip it entirely, due to resource constraints or other reasons.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Preload</h2>

      <p>The <dfn>preload</dfn> hint is used to indicate the URL of a resource that, if fetched by the user agent, could improve page performance: initiate an early fetch to mask request latency and make it available sooner to the application, or fetch a resource that may be required by the next user action or navigation such that it can deliver an instant response once the resource is requested.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight html">
  &lt;!-- fetch immediately + preprocess if possible --&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/logo-small.jpeg" as="image" media="screen and (max-width: 640px)"&gt;

  &lt;!-- fetch immediately + do not preprocess --&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="/components/widget.html" as="html" loadpolicy="inert"&gt;

  &lt;!-- low-priority fetch + preprocess if possible -->
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/next-page.html" as="html" loadpolicy="next"&gt;

  &lt;!-- low-priority fetch + do not preprocess --&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/next-component.html" as="html" loadpolicy="next inert"&gt;
      </pre>

      <div class="note">
        The `next inert` <a>loadpolicy</a> is semantically equivalent to `rel=prefetch` implemented by some browsers; `next` <a>loadpolicy</a> is semantically equivalent to `rel=prerender` implemented by some browsers. The <a>preload</a> hint standardizes and extends previous prefetch and prerender hints with more flexible fetch and processing policies.
      </div>

      <section>
        <h2>Fetch settings</h2>

        <p>The <code><dfn>as</dfn></code> attribute allows the developer to communicate the <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-context">request context</> so that the user agent can initialize the appropriate fetch settings: relative request priority, appropriate HTTP headers, and so on.</p>

        <pre class="example highlight html">
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/font.woff" as="font"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/logo.webp" as="image"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/widget"&gt;
        </pre>

        <ul>
          <li>The specified <code><a>as</a></code> value MUST be a valid <a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-context">request context</a> as defined in [[FETCH]].</li>
          <li>If the <code><a>as</a></code> attribute is missing, the user agent should assign a default context.</li>
          <li>Request defaults set by the user agent via <code><a>as</a></code> attribute MUST match the default settings set by the user agent when processing a resource with the same context - this is necessary to guarantee correct prioritization and request matching (see <a href="#matching-hint-responses-with-requests"></a>).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
          The resource destination context communicated via the <code><a>as</a></code> attribute is only used to initialize appropriate fetch settings; the communicated context is not meant to enforce security or other resource policies.
        </div>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Load and processing policy</h2>

        <p>The <dfn>loadpolicy</dfn> attribute consists of a space-separated set of the following keywords that determine the load and processing policy of the specified resource:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>next</dfn></dt> 
          <dd>Indicates that the specified resource is required by the next navigation context, and that the user agent SHOULD fetch the resource if possible.</dd>

          <dt><dfn>inert</dfn></dt> 
          <dd>Indicates that the user agent SHOULD NOT apply any preprocessing on the response - e.g., decode an image ahead of time, preparse HTML markup, parse the HTML markup and fetch and apply resources (i.e. render the next page), and so on.</dd>
        </dl>

        <pre class="example highlight html">
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/font.woff" as="font" loadpolicy="next"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/logo.webp" as="image" loadpolicy="next inert"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/widget"&gt;
        </pre>

        <div class="note">
        <p>An empty <a>loadpolicy</a> indicates that the resource is required for the current navigation context, and that the user agent may apply relevant preprocessing to optimize page performance.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Fetches initiated via preload can negatively impact the performance of the current navigation context. Due to the need to fetch and optionally preprocess the specified resource and its associated assets, preloading can result in high contention for the CPU, GPU, memory, and network resources. To address this, the user agent MUST take into account the specified <a>loadpolicy</a>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Resource fetches with <a>next</a> loadpolicy MUST have lower relative priority and should not block or interfere with resource fetches required by the current navigation context.</li>

          <li>The optimal time to initiate a preload resource fetch is dependent on the specified <a>loadpolicy</a>, negotiated transport protocol, users current connectivity profile, available device resources, and other context specific variables.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If <a>next</a> keyword is omitted, the user agent MUST initiate the fetch as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>If <a>next</a> keyword is present, the user agent should determine the optimal time at which to initiate the fetch - e.g. the user agent can decide to wait until all other downloads are finished, or choose to pipeline requests with low priority if the negotiated protocol supports the necessary primitives. Alternatively, the user agent MAY opt-out from initiating the fetch due to resource constraints, user preferences, or other factors.</li>
          </ul>

          <li>By default, the user agent may perform appropriate preprocessing on the preloaded resource depending on the type and destination context of the response. Preprocessing prepares the resource to be applied, but it does not automatically execute or apply it against the current page context.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The decision for which preprocessing steps are performed is deferred to the user agent.</li>
            <li>The user agent MUST NOT apply any preprocessing when the <a>inert</a> keyword is present - e.g. the developer may want to opt-out from preprocessing the next HTML document and its sub-resources.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>The user agent SHOULD perform preprocessing of applicable resources, and may implement various strategies to minimize resource contention based on the type and context of fetched response, impose limits on the properties of the resource that is being preloaded, and so on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The user agent MAY allocate fewer CPU, GPU, or memory resources to preprocessing.</li>

          <li>When preprocessing an HTML document, some resource the use agent MAY delay requests until the preloaded resource is made visible - e.g. media downloads, plugin content, and so on.</li>

          <li>A user agent MAY abandon preprocessing due to resource constraints.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A user agent MAY prevent preprocessing from being initiated when there are limited resources available.</li>
            <li>High resource requirements of the preloaded content may lead the user agent to cancel preprocessing - e.g. exceeded memory requirements, high CPU usage, and so on.</li>
          </ul>

          <li>A user agent MAY abandon preprocessing based on the type or properties of the preloaded content. For example, when preprocessing an HTML response:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If the target exhibits non-idempotent behavior: mutations to shared local storage, XMLHttpRequest with a verb other than GET, HEAD, or OPTION, and so on.</li>
            <li>If the target triggers a condition that requires user input: confirmation dialogs, authentication prompts, alerts, and so on.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>The above processing strategies are not an exhaustive list. The decision which strategies to implement for each content-type and how to enforce them is deferred to the user agent.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>To ensure compatibility and improve the success rate of speculative preload requests the target page should use the [[PAGE-VISIBILITY]] to determine the visibility state of the page as it is being rendered and implement appropriate logic to avoid actions that may cause the preload to be abandoned (e.g. non-idempotent requests), or unwanted side-effects from being triggered (e.g. analytics beacons firing prior to the page being displayed).</p>

          TODO: Resource hints are subject to <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#attr-link-media">media query processing</a>: the user agent must initiate resource fetch when media attribute's value matches the environment, and must not initiate the fetch otherwise.

    <h2>Processing model</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Required vs speculative hints</h2>

      <p>In addition to specifying the hint type, its fetch parameters, and the resource URL, the developer can communicate the expected probability that the resource will be used in the current or next navigation context.</p>

      <pre class="highlight example html">
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//sub.example.com" pr="0.22"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/application.js" pr="0.75"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/thankyou.html"&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>The <dfn>pr</dfn> attribute is a float value in the [0.0-1.0] range:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Required hint:</strong> a hint with probability of 1.0 that must be processed by the user agent.</li>
        <li><strong>Speculative hint:</strong> a hint with probability of &lt;1.0 or <a>loadpolicy</a> containing <a>next</a> keyword. Speculative hints should be processed by the user agent when possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the <a>pr</a> attribute is omitted, the hint is considered to be a required hint (i.e. it has a probability of 1.0), unless the <a>loadpolicy</a> contains the <a>next</a> keyword. Speculative hints are processed on a best effort basis by the user agent based on the runtime context of the user agent &mdash; availability of CPU, GPU, memory, and networking resources &mdash; developer specified probability indicating the likelihood of that resource being used, and specified user preferences.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The user agent MAY decide to execute some, none, or all of the optimizations implied by a speculative resource hint, and may also invoke additional optimizations based on its own heuristics.</li>

        <li>The user agent MAY decide to execute a partial optimization relative to the speculative hint due to resource constraints or other reasons.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><a>preconnect</a> MAY fallback to a partial handshake (DNS only, or DNS+TCP for HTTPS origins).</li>
          <li><a>preload</a> MAY fallback to <a>preconnect</a> for specified origin, or apply a custom preprocessing strategy for the target resource, and if applicable, its sub-resources: <a>preconnect</a> only; fetch the target resource but defer fetch of sub-resources; fetch sub-resources but delay their processing, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The user agent MAY decide to not cancel outstanding fetches initiated via a required or speculative hint when a new navigation is invoked - e.g., if the navigation is to the same origin, the resource may be required by the next page. However, the user agent MAY cancel these requests once it determines that they are not required by the new destination.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        <p>To optimize the overall user experience the user agent should account for local context and specified probability of a speculative hint. For example, on a resource constrained device the user agent may decide to only execute high probability hints. Alternatively, it MAY decide to perform partial processing of the hint, such as downgrading <a>preload</a> to <a>preconnect</a>, performing partial preprocessing, and so on.</p>

        <p>Performing a partial optimization allows the user agent to improve performance even if a full optimization cannot be performed. Conversely, on a device with sufficient resources, the user agent may execute all of the specified hints as far as possible.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hint execution</h2>

      <p>The user agent MUST NOT <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#delay-the-load-event">delay the `load` event</a> of the document unless the hint-initiated fetch is matched with a matching request that blocks the `load` event of the document.</p>

      <p>Once the attempt to obtain the hint-initiated resource is complete, the user agent MUST, if the fetch was successful, queue a task to fire a simple event named `load` at the `link` element, or, if the fetch failed to complete for any reason, queue a task to fire a simple event named `error` at the `link` element.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the user agent is executing a required hint, then the `load` event on the link element is an indicator that the hint was processed to completion.</li>
        <li>If the user agent is executing a speculative hint, then the `load` event on the link element is an indicator that the user agent has performed full or partial processing on the hint (see <a href="#required-vs-speculative-hints"></a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <pre class="example highlight html">
&lt;script&gt;
  function hintLoaded(e) { ... }
  function hintError(e)  { ... }

  var hint = document.createElement("link");
  hint.rel = "preload";
  hint.as = "image";
  hint.href = "/image.jpg";
  document.head.appendChild(hint);

  // listen for load/error events
  hint.addEventListener("load", hintLoaded)
  hint.addEventListener("error", hintError)
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- listen for load/error events --&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="app.js" as="script" onload="hintLoaded()" onerror="hintError()"&gt;
      </pre>

      <div class="note">
        The decision on whether a speculative hint is executed, and if so, whether full or partial processing is applied is deferred to the user agent. As a result, the `load` and `error` events are not guaranteed to fire for a speculative hint, and when they do, do not guarantee that full processing was applied.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        The application can use the `load` event on a <a>preload</a> hint as an indicator that the resource has been successfully fetched and is now ready to be processed by the application - e.g. the image is ready to be decoded, a stylesheet or script can be applied to a document, and so on, without blocking on the network.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dynamic scheduling</h2>
      <p>In addition to the hints specified in the document markup, the application can have runtime resource hints based on user context or other signals. The user agent SHOULD process dynamically inserted resource hints in addition to, and in the same way as, markup-declared hints.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight js">
  // insert new preload hint
  var hint = document.createElement("link");
  hint.rel = "preload";
  hint.loadpolicy = "next";
  hint.href = "/article/part3.html";
  document.head.appendChild(hint);

  // cancel preload
  document.head.removeChild(hint);
      </pre>

      <p>The removal of the hint from the document MUST cancel the optimization if it is being processed and prevent it from executing if it has not yet been invoked.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>The application can use dynamic scheduling to react and adapt to user initiated actions - e.g. initiate a speculative resource fetch in response to recent user activity, cancel previous speculative fetch, and so on.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Interoperability with HTTP Link header</h2>
      <p>It OPTIONAL for a user agent to support [[!RFC598]].</p>
      <p>A user agent that support [[!RFC5988]] SHOULD process resource hints specified via the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">Link HTTP header</a>.</p>

      <pre class="example">
  Link: &lt;https://example.com&gt;; rel=preconnect
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/font.woff&gt;; rel=preload; as=font
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/article/part2.html&gt;; rel=preload
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/logo-hires.jpg&gt;; rel=preload; as=image; media=min-resolution:2dppx
      </pre>

      <p>The application can provide one or more of the same type of hint via multiple HTTP headers or via a comma separated list. The user agent SHOULD process such hints in addition to and in the same way as document specified and dynamically scheduled resource hints.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>Delivering resource hints via `Link` headers allows services that perform automated optimizations, running on origin or upstream servers (e.g. CDN), to leverage and emit resource hints without modifying the response body.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The optimization service may leverage specified hints to preconnect, preload, or prefetch resources into its own cache, which will assist in faster delivery when the request arrives from the client.</li>
          <li>The optimization service may emit resource hints based own optimization heuristics (e.g. inferred page structure, request patterns, and so on) to assist the user agent.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Matching hint responses with requests</h2>

      <p>Resources fetched via <a>preload</a> are retained by the user agent until they are fetched with a matching request. The user agent MAY decide to discard the retained response due to resource constraints, a timeout (recommended, at least 300 seconds), or other reasons.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>A JavaScript resource is fetched via <a>preload</a> and the response contains a `no-cache` directive. The fetched response is retained by the user agent and is immediately returned when fetched with a matching request at a later time - e.g. via a `script` tag or other means. This ensures that the user agent does not incur an unnecessary revalidation, or a duplicate download, between the initial resource fetch initiated via the specified resource hint and a later fetch requesting the same resource.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="note">
        <p>The concept of "matching" is not currently defined or interoperable across user agents. This should be fixed, but it is out of scope of this specification. For further discussion see <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/resource-hints/issues/5">this bug</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/net-dev/cFhaIoJCRFg/3JX9lPWnDPIJ">chromium discussion</a>.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Use cases</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Dynamic request URL (preconnect)</h2>
      <p>The full resource URL may not be known until the page is being constructed by the user agent - e.g. conditional loading logic, UA adaptation, etc. However, the origin from which one or more of these resources will be fetched is often known ahead of time by the developer or the server generating the response. In such cases, a <a title="preconnect">preconnect hint</a> can be used to initiate an early connection handshake such that when the resource URL is determined, the user agent can dispatch the request without first blocking on connection negotiation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Anonymizing redirect (preconnect)</h2>
      <p>Many sites rely on redirects for analytics and to anonymize the referrer before sending the user to the final destination. Because the destination is known ahead of time, a <a title="preconnect">preconnect hint</a> can be used to initiate the connection handshake with the destination origin in parallel with the processing of the redirect. Note that this behavior requires ability to dynamically inject the hint (e.g. as part of a JavaScript handler), and for the preconnect processing to proceed across page navigations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Early fetch of critical resources (preload)</h2>
      <p>Speculative parsers do not execute JavaScript and perform a shallow parse of CSS, which means that the fetch of resources specified within JavaScript and CSS is delayed until the document parser is able to process the resource declaration. By using a <a title="preload">preload hint</a> the application can declaratively specify which resources the user agent should fetch early to mask the request latency and improve page performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Early fetch with on-demand processing (preload)</h2>
      <p>The <a title="preload">preload hint</a> can be used by the application to initiate early fetch, but delay processing of the received response - e.g. fetch a CSS stylesheet and apply it at some later time, fetch a JavaScript asset and execute it later, and so on. Preload fetches do not block the document `load` event and allow the application to determine which resources are applied, when they are executed, and in which order.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Developer, server, and proxy-generated hints (preload)</h2>
      <p>The <a title="preload">preload hint</a> can be generated both by the application and an optimization proxy (e.g. a CDN) to accelerate fetch and delivery of required resources.

        <ol>
          <li>The application can specify preload hints, allowing:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The optimization proxy to initiate early fetch of the associated resources and place them into its cache, thus reducing or eliminating the latency of retrieving resources from the origin.</li>
            <li>The user agent to initiate early fetch of required resources - see example above.</li>
          </ul>

          <li>The optimization proxy can specify preload hints on behalf of the application:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The proxy can observe and infer required resources based on past request patterns, allowing it to automate generation of relevant preload hints to improve performance.</li>
            <li>The proxy can deliver inferred preload hints to the user agent while it is blocked on the response from the origin, allowing the user agent to begin fetching required resources.</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>Many optimization proxies already implement the "early flush" strategy where references to required resources are delivered to the user agent while the proxy is blocked on the response from the origin. Today, this is typically done by synthesizing a document header that contains XHR, image, and object requests. However, in practice, these implementations often result in prioritization conflicts with requests initiated by speculative and document parsers, or worse, result in delayed or double downloads due to missing context information. The <a title="preload">preload hint</a> addresses these problems by providing a declarative hint that communicates both the URL and the context of the resource.</p>

      <h2>Speculative fetching (preload)</h2>
       <p>The <a title="preload">preload hint</a> can be used to implement a prefetch strategy that leverages app-specific knowledge about the next navigation based on content, structure, analytics, or other signals - e.g. high-likelihood search results, paginated content or step-driven flows, aggregated analytics or per-user behavior, and so on.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>For example, an image gallery may have knowledge about the likelihood of the next photo or page that may be requested by the user. To provide an improved experience the application can ask the user agent to begin fetching required resources (individual photos, critical resources, or the full page) before the next navigation is triggered.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Alternatively, instead of anticipating user activity, the application can react to user input and dynamically schedule preload requests based on its knowledge of resources that will be required by the next navigation target - i.e. the application may capture a click event and provide preload hints to the user agent before the current page is unloaded.</p>
